Export your Trello data to Google Docs","body":"# LionelRichie\r\n\r\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rossta/lionel_richie.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rossta/lionel_richie)\r\n\r\nLionelRichie is a script for exporting Trello data to Google Docs.\r\n\r\n![Trello? Is it me you're looking for?](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRmSbZ56riC_raK-rR4HiV4YKjvXTTUQy4_GCpPAYqdSkCz3RhO)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'lionel_richie'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install lionel_richie\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nAssuming you have a Google account, a Trello account, and a board you want to export to google docs, you're ready to start using lionel_richie.\r\n\r\nYou'll first need to authorize your CLI to use the Trello and Google APIs.\r\n\r\nTo authorize, sign in to Trello and run the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ lionel authorize trello\r\n\r\nThis command will direct you to a URL which has your trello key. Enter this into the CLI. You'll then be directed to a URL where you'll authorize the application to get your trello token. If you entered the key and token correctly, you should now be authorized to use Trello.\r\n\r\nTo authorize Google, run the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ lionel authorize google\r\n\r\nThis command will direct you to the [Google API console](https://code.google.com/apis/console). You'll need to create a Google client app for LionelRichie. Feel free to call it whatever you want. Once you have registered a client app, click the tab \"API Access\", then \"Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID\" to open up a modal. Set a client name, like \"CLI\" for command line interface and continue. Next the modal presents \"Client ID Settings\"; choose \"Installed Application\" for \"Application type\", and \"Other\" for \"Installed application type\". Now press \"Create client ID\". From your newly created client settings, grab the client id and client secret. Enter them in the CLI.\r\n\r\nYou'll then be directed to authorize the application and retrieve your google token.\r\n\r\nYou should now be ready to run the export:\r\n\r\n    $ lionel export                         # uploads to your google doc\r\n    $ lionel export --print                 # prints the output without uploading\r\n    $ lionel export -c ./path/to/Lionelfile # uploads export configured by given Lionelfile\r\n\r\nWhen running this command for the first time, you'll be asked to enter your trello board id and google doc id, which you can grab from the respective URLs of those resources.\r\n\r\nRun `lionel` to see a list of the available commands and options.\r\n\r\n## Crafting the Export\r\n\r\nThe export can be configured using the export DSL. Export methods take the form of a Google doc column, e.g. 'A', 'BC', etc. To set the value on a column, pass a value or a block. The block is rendered in the context of each `Card` object populated with data from Trello.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Lionelfile\r\nLionelRichie.export do\r\n  # Card Id\r\n  B { id }\r\n\r\n  # Card Link\r\n  C { link }\r\n\r\n  # Ready date\r\n  D do |export|\r\n    ready_action = first_action do |a|\r\n      (a.create? && a.board_id == export.trello_board_id) || a.moved_to?(\"Ready\")\r\n    end\r\n    format_date(ready_action.date) if ready_action\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # In Progress date\r\n  E { date_moved_to(\"In Progress\") }\r\n\r\n  # Code Review date\r\n  F { date_moved_to(\"Code Review\") }\r\n\r\n  # Review date\r\n  G { date_moved_to(\"Review\") }\r\n\r\n  # Deploy date\r\n  H { date_moved_to(\"Deploy\") }\r\n\r\n  # Completed date\r\n  I { date_moved_to(\"Completed\") }\r\n\r\n  # Type\r\n  J { type }\r\n\r\n  # Project\r\n  K { project }\r\n\r\n  # Estimate\r\n  L { estimate }\r\n\r\n  # Due Date\r\n  M { due_date }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
